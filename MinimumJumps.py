# Given an array arr[] of size n of non-negative integers. 
# Each array element represents the maximum length of the jumps that can be made forward from that element. 
# This means if arr[i] = x, then we can jump any distance y such that y â‰¤ x.
# Find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array starting from the first element. 
# If an element is 0, then you cannot move through that element.
# Note:  Return -1 if you can't reach the end of the array.

# Input: arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 8, 9, 2, 6, 7, 6, 8, 9}, n = 11
# Output: 3 
# Explanation:First jump from 1st element to 2nd element with value 3. 
#             From here we jump to 5th element with value 9, and from here we will jump to the last.
